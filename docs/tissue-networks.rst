Tissue-specific Networks
===========================

The precise actions of genes are frequently dependent on their tissue context, and human diseases result from the disordered interplay of tissue- and cell lineage–specific processes. These factors combine to make the understanding of tissue-specific gene functions, disease pathophysiology and gene-disease associations particularly challenging. 


Functional interactions
---------------------------

HumanBase builds genome-scale functional maps of human tissues by integrating a collection of data sets covering thousands of experiments contained in more than 14,000 distinct publications. To integrate these data, we automatically assess each data set for its relevance to each of 144 tissue- and cell lineage–specific functional contexts. The resulting functional maps provide a detailed portrait of protein function and interactions in specific human tissues and cell lineages ranging from B lymphocytes to the renal glomerulus and the whole brain. This approach allows us to profile the specialized function of genes in a high-throughput manner, even in tissues and cell lineages for which no or few tissue-specific data exist.

These maps can answer biological questions that are specific to a single gene in a single tissue. For example, we have used these maps for the gene IL1B (encoding interleukin (IL)-1β) in the blood vessel network, where it has a key role in inflammation, to predict lineage-specific responses to IL-1β stimulation, which we experimentally confirmed. 

Data types
---------------------------
We collected and integrated 987 genome-scale data sets encompassing approximately 38,000 conditions from an estimated 14,000 publications including both expression and interaction measurements.
