Genome coordinates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We support only ``GRCh37/hg19`` genome coordinates. You can use LiftOver to convert your coordinates to the correct version.

Large submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We recommend using the web server if you have <10,000 variants or sequences. You will experience degraded performance when submitting a larger set of sequences. In those instances, we suggest that you split the set into multiple <10,000 submissions, or run the standalone version on your local machine, or contact our group directly.
