NetWAS - Network-wide Association Study

About
---------------------------------------

Tissue-specific networks provide a new means to generate hypotheses related to the molecular basis of human disease. We developed an approach, termed network-wide association study (NetWAS). In NetWAS, the statistical associations from a standard GWAS guide the analysis of functional networks. This reprioritization method is driven by discovery and does not depend on prior disease knowledge. NetWAS, in conjunction with tissue-specific networks, effectively reprioritizes statistical associations from distinct GWAS to identify disease-associated genes, and tissue-specific NetWAS better identifies genes associated with hypertension than either GWAS or tissue-naive NetWAS.
