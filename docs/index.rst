HumanBase User Guide
=====================

HumanBase is a resource for biological researchers interested in data-driven predictions of gene expression, function, regulation, and interactions in human, particularly in the context of specific cell types/tissues and human disease.

This resource is not merely a public database of primary genomics data or biological literature. The data-driven integrative analyses (i.e. algorithms that “learn” from large genomic data collections) presented in HumanBase are especially powerful because they separate signal from noise in large biological data collections to reach beyond existing biological knowledge represented in the biological literature to identify novel associations that are not biased toward well-studied areas of biomedical research. Carefully designed algorithms can drive the development of experimentally testable hypotheses. Thus, HumanBase is a resource for biomedical researchers to incorporate into their research workflows, which they can use to interpret their experimental results and generate hypotheses for experimental follow-up.

All methods included in HumanBase are previously published and extensively evaluated. See the :doc:`citations` section for references to the original publication for each method.
