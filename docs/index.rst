About
---------------------

HumanBase is a “one stop shop” for biological and biomedical researchers interested in data-driven predictions of gene expression, function, regulation, and interactions in human, particularly in the context of specific cell types/tissues, development, and human disease.

Data-driven integrative analyses are especially powerful because they reach beyond “known biological knowledge” represented in the biological literature to identify novel associations that are not biased toward well-studied areas of biomedical research. Thus, carefully designed algorithms can drive the development of experimentally testable hypotheses, enabling deeper understanding of basic biology at the molecular level, pathophysiology, and paving the way to therapy and drug development.
