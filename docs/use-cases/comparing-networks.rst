Comparing networks use case
===========================

This use case is drawn from Akat et al. 2022, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and wnt pathway-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms

**Task: How do the relationships between my genes of interest differ between lung tissue and fetal tissue?**


* Input bronchopulmonary dysplasia-related genes of interest. Select “Search.”

* Select the first tissue type of interest (lung). Select “Add Network” and choose the second tissue type of interest (fetus).
