DeepSEA Analysis
=================

Introduction
------------

DeepSEA is a deep learning framework that predicts genomic variant effects on a wide range of regulatory features with single nucleotide sensitivity: transcription factors binding, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and histone marks in multiple human cell types.

DeepSEA-based Methods
---------------------

The following analysis tools and methods in HumanBase are built upon the DeepSEA framework:

* :doc:`sei` - Sequence-based regulatory element activity prediction
* :doc:`beluga` - DeepSEA Beluga model for chromatin profiling predictions  
* :doc:`seqweaver` - Sequence-based variant effect prediction
* :doc:`expecto` - Tissue-specific gene expression prediction from sequence
* :doc:`expectosc` - Single-cell expression effect prediction framework
* :doc:`in-silico-mutagenesis` - In silico mutagenesis analysis using DeepSEA
